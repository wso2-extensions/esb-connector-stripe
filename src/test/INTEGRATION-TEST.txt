Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB Stripe connector
Pre-requisites:

- Maven 3.x
- Java 1.6 or above
- The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this     project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean   install command to update your local repository:
       https://github.com/wso2-dev/esb-connectors/tree/master/integration-base

Tested Platform: 

- Mac OSx 10.9
- WSO2 ESB wso2esb-5.0.0
- Java 1.8

STEPS:
1.  Download ESB 5.0.0 from official website and extract the ESB and add "-noverify" under $JVM_MEM_OPTS into {ESB_HOME}/bin/wso2server.sh.

2. Make sure the wso2esb-5.0.0.zip file at "<STRIPE_CONNECTORS_HOME>/repository/".
        Make sure your axis2.xml contains following entries.

            <messageFormatter contentType="multipart/form-data" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.http.MultipartFormDataFormatter"/>

            <messageBuilder contentType="multipart/form-data" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

        Be sure to import the Stripe certificate to your ESB client keystore.
        You can follow the following steps to import your Stripe certificates into wso2esb clientâ€™s keystore as follows:
           1. Go to https://stripe.com/docs/connect/oauth in your browser, and then click the HTTPS trust icon on the address bar (e.g., the padlock next to the URL in Firefox).
           2. View the certificate details (the steps vary by browser) and then export the trust certificate to the file system.
           3. Use the ESB Management Console or the following command to import that certificate into the ESB client keystore.
                 keytool -importcert -file DigiCertSHA2ExtendedValidationServerCA.crt -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "StripeTrustCertImport"
           4. Restart the server and deploy the Stripe configuration.

3. Edit the "stripe.properties" at "<STRIPE_CONNECTORS_HOME>/src/test/resources/artifacts/connector/config" using valid and relevant data. Parameters to be changed are mentioned below.

    - proxyDirectoryRelativePath: relative path of the rest request files folder from target.
    - requestDirectoryRelativePath: relative path of proxy folder from target.
    - propertiesFilePath: relative path of properties file from target.
    - apikey: apikey from the created app.
    - apiUrl: API URL.

4. Following data set can be used for the first test suite run.

        proxyDirectoryRelativePath=/../src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/proxies/stripe/
        requestDirectoryRelativePath=/../src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/restRequests/stripe/
        propertiesFilePath=/../src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/connector/config/
        apiUrl=https://api.stripe.com
        apiVersion=v1
        apikey=xxxxxxxxxx
        Go to stripe app and create an invoice line item for a customer and provide that responding customer id from UI for customerIdInvoice
        customerIdInvoice=xxxxxx

5. Required to change on test
    change the relevant data in the corresponding text file(Text files in the rest requests folder)
